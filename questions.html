                    <h3>Can I keep my clothes on?</h3>
                    <p>Shawna will work with you and fit to your needs, but massage is best enjoyed and benefits are found when skin is exposed for the massage. You will always be properly draped with a sheet and blanket, and only the area being massaged will be exposed. Your comfort and privacy are our top priorities.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How old do I have to be?</h3>
                    <p>To sign the consent form, you must be 18 years old. For clients under 18, a parent or guardian must be present to sign the consent form and may need to be present during the session.</p>

                    <h3>I have a health condition, can I still receive a massage?</h3>
                    <p>Shawna will determine an individual's ability to receive massage based on the intake form. She holds the right to refuse massage to anyone and recommend alternate care if necessary. It's important to inform Shawna of any medical conditions, injuries, or medications you're taking before your session. Some conditions may require modifications to the massage, while others might require clearance from your healthcare provider.</p>

                    <h3>What should I expect during my first massage?</h3>
                    <p>During your first visit, you'll fill out an intake form to discuss your health history, any areas of concern, and your goals for the session. Shawna will review this with you and customize the massage to meet your specific needs. You'll be given privacy to undress to your comfort level and lie on the massage table under a sheet and blanket. Throughout the session, we encourage you to communicate about pressure and comfort level.</p>

                    <p>Massage should not be painful. While some techniques may involve some discomfort as we work through tight areas, you should always feel comfortable. Shawna will adjust based on your feedback. It's important to communicate with her about pressure levels throughout the session.</p>

                    <h3>How often should I get a massage?</h3>
                    <p>The frequency of massages depends on your individual needs and goals. For general wellness and stress relief, monthly massages are often beneficial. If you're dealing with chronic pain or recovering from an injury, more frequent sessions may be recommended. Shawna can help you determine the best schedule for your needs.</p>
